# cousera-ml

Python port of the Coursera-Stanford Machine Learning Matlab code

## How to use:
Just download or clone the repository, name your solution like the corresponding **.m** file but change the extension to **.py** and finally run:
```
python submit.py
```

## Code design and organization

Same structure of the Matlab code `ex1`, `ex2`, etc folders with corresponding **.py** files instead of **.m** files. There should also be a test file per folder, ex: `ex1/test_ex1.py`.

## Requirements

* numpy
* pytest (optional for testing)

## Development Roadmap

* Implement quicklogin
* More testing
* Add templates for remaining exercises

## Testing

Set your email as an environment variable with `export COURSERA_EMAIL='your@email.com'` and then run `py.test`
